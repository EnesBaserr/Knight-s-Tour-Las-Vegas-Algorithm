## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

You can run the program using the command line. Navigate to the directory containing the `2020400141.py` file, then run one of the following commands:

## Command 
- python 2020400141.py `partX`
- partX : `part1` or `part2`
- `part2` use backtracing logic to handle more success for given case.
- `part1` focuses on more randomness so it's normal to see lower probabilites compared to `part2` 
## Example
- python 2020400141.py part1
## Suggestions 
- One can make changes for size of the input instead of `n = 8`.
- Also can configure p and k values.
